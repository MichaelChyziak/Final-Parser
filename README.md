FinalProject
============
- We can try and communicate over the master's "ReadMe" file on what we are working on and what each person should do and if we finish something or have any questions.
- (MC) create your thing with the initials inside a bracket to keep track of who says what, and no need to delete stuff since we might go back on an implementation and see if the idea we used to had might be better than what we thought of later.
