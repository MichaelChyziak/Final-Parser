FinalProject
============
- We can try and communicate over the master's "ReadMe" file on what we are working on and what each person should do and if we finish something or have any questions.
- (MC) create your thing with the initials inside a bracket to keep track of who says what, and no need to delete stuff since we might go back on an implementation and see if the idea we used to had might be better than what we thought of later.
- (MC) I did some work in my branch (all the files there are the only edited ones, all others stayed the same). I fixed up our assignment statements again so hopefully no bugs with it this time. I also started writing the code for finding the type that an identifier is. So far I just testing "int a = 5;" and it stores "a" as an "int". So it works for that case, but its still a work in progress, but feel free to look and copy any code into your branch and edit it around.
